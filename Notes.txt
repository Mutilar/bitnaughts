Economy:
--------

-Couriers (for FTL communications, warp-capable ships are required, thus, couriers are viable for transmitting data between solar systems)
-- Take data (bits) from one system, fly them to another system, and get paid.
-- Alternately, you can snoop through the bits you are carrying to find other secrets
-- Some bits might be protected, use decryption to read them

-Freighters (for bulk shipments, large ships are required, thus, freighters are as common a sight as on a modern highway)
-- Buy cargo (or do via a quest system), fly it to somewhere that has a higher demand, and get paid.
-- Alternately, you could raid existing freighters and take their cargo
-- Some freighters will have protection, meaning you need to have weapons systems advanced enough to win the fight

-Research (for technology to advance, there is a huge demand for research in all sectors)
-- Scan objects, write code, etc for the betterment of the galaxy

-Policing (to keep order, pirates and military enemies need to be destroyed via crowdsourcing)
-- Find a bounty, track down the target vessel, and destroy it

-Conscription (to bolster militaries, war vessels can be conscripted to fight in battles)
-- Get paid to fight for a military group
-- Alternately, flee battle and risk having a bounty put on you

-Entrepenuership (for those with extra capital, one can invest in industries to make money in the long term)
-- Buy or found an industry, but take on the risk of it failing, being destroyed, attacked, etc. 
-- Alternately, you can invade an existing planet and usurp their industries, but risk bounties/massive retaliation.

-Gambling (out-code a rigged game for money)
