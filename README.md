To set up the development environment, see [bitnaughts.unity](https://github.com/bitnaughts/bitnaughts.unity).

BitNaughts is a retro sci-fi competitive programming MMO like no other. Instead of grinding levels to beat your opponents, the champion of the galaxy is who ever can write the most optimized, most effective, and most deadly code.
