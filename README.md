Asset Folder for BitNaughts

[Website](http://bitnaughts.github.io)

## Initiatilization:
In Unity 2018.3, clone this repository into a new project's asset folder.

## Background:
Combining the science fiction of galaxy exploration with the maximum possible level of customization:
being able to code every aspect of your own space ship to optimize it against your foes.

## Technically Speaking:
We aim to create a C# interpreter to parse user-generated code in real time to control systems on their space ship(s) exactly how they want.
