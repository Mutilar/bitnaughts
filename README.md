To set up the development environment, see [bitnaughts.unity](https://github.com/bitnaughts/bitnaughts.unity).

Explore a galaxy in the aftermath of Earth's second nuclear winter. Most technology has been forgotten, except for space travel and interpreted programming languages of course. Build your spaceship, code your systems, and set out in an exciting multiplayer universe that is full of surprises.

BitNaughts is a retro sci-fi competitive programming MMO like no other. Instead of grinding levels to beat your opponents, the champion of the galaxy is who ever can write the most optimized, most effective, and most deadly code. 

BitNaughts is an educational yet competitive coding video game where players succeed off of the merit of their code. We believe video games are a great medium to teach the next generations anything from puzzle-solving skills to computer science concepts in a gamified environment.

# Coding Interpreter

Striving to have the maximum level of customization, BitNaughts allows players to customize the code of every aspect of their ships.

This serves as a gameplay tool (again, customizability) and an educational opportunity for those interested in or proficient in computer science. Of course, for those not interested in coding, the game is playable without having to write a single line in our interpreter, but over time, even those who might at first feel intimidated by coding will try it out.

# Network / Backend

### MMOs: 
-Large number of players, community
-Performance limited by bandwidth, server-client communications

### Single Player: 
-One player, lack of community
-Performance limited by graphics card/processor

MMOs typical have less exciting, more deterministic gameplay as a result of having to keep each player’s actions simpler to be transmitted over the internet. Single player games tend to have more flashy graphics, but feel more isolated, as if your actions matter less.

We want to bridge this gap and offer a large, thriving online community while keeping gameplay rich and complex. Thus, the concept is to have the game be “single player” but for NPCs to be other players’ ships.
